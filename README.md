## hydroelectric
a simple way to revise notes

![Hydroelectric Logo](hydroelectric-small.png)

### Please read 
- **This application contains a lot of messy code and is in the process of being rewritten as a Ruby on Rails app instead of a PHP app heavily dependent on ajax**
- **The heavy dependency on ajax has resulted in Hydroelectric not working in some browsers such as IE7**

## Description

Hydroelectric organises revision notes into topics and subjects and displays these notes.

Since revision notes need to be accessed wherever a user is, Hydroelectric uses a web interface to allow this.

## Requirements

* Apache
* MySQL
* PHP

## Installation

1. Comment out the AppFog MySQL connection in config.php unless you are using AppFog
1. Create a new MySQL database
1. Uncomment the database connection credentials in config.php and add your credentials
1. Start your PHP server, go to localhost in your browser and follow the installer
